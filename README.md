Short intro to graphs

## What is a graph? 

A **graph** is a collection of nodes which stores data and edges which represent relationships or connection between nodes. Unlike other relationships between nodes, graphs do not simply have parent / child relationships. Instead, they are defined as **directed**, which is to say, one node leads to another, and **undirected**, a mutual connection between the nodes. Graphs are represented in code in two different ways: via an **adjacency list**, where there is a collection of arrays for each node, and an **adjacency matrix**, which is represented by a two-dimensional array.
